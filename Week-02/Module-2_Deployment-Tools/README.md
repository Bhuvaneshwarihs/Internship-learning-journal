 Week-02: Deployment tools and workflows
# Module 2 — Deployment Tools and their workflows (TDS Internship)

## Overview

This module introduces how data science and AI applications are shared with others.
Instead of running code locally, we learn how to deploy apps, create APIs, automate workflows, and manage environments.

The focus is on making projects **interactive, reproducible, and accessible online**.

## Topics Covered

### Images: Compression

Image compression reduces file size while preserving visual quality.
It improves application performance by decreasing loading time and bandwidth usage during deployment.

---

### REST APIs

REST APIs allow different systems to communicate over HTTP using structured endpoints.
They convert scripts and models into reusable services that can be accessed by dashboards, apps, and other programs.

---

### CORS

CORS controls which origins can access an API from a browser.
It is a security mechanism required when frontend and backend run on different domains or ports.

---

### Tunneling: ngrok

ngrok creates a temporary public URL for a locally running application.
It is useful for demos, testing integrations, and sharing work before full deployment.

---

### Containers: Docker, Podman

Containers package applications with all dependencies to ensure reproducibility across environments.
Docker and Podman enable portable deployment of ML services.

---

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions

CI/CD automates integration, testing, building, and deployment workflows.
GitHub Actions allows projects to run tasks automatically when code changes.

---

### DevContainers: GitHub Codespaces

DevContainers define consistent development environments using containers.
GitHub Codespaces builds these environments in the cloud for collaborative development.

---

### Web Framework: FastAPI

FastAPI is used to expose models and data pipelines as APIs.
It acts as the service layer connecting ML logic with applications.

---

### Authentication: Google Auth

Authentication ensures only authorized users can access deployed applications.
Google Auth simplifies login by delegating identity verification to Google.

---

## Key Learnings

* Deployment is essential for sharing data science work
* APIs convert models into services
* Containers ensure reproducible environments
* Automation improves reliability
* Authentication secures applications

---

## Conclusion

This module highlights the transition from experimentation to production.
By combining APIs, containers, automation, and hosting platforms, data science projects become complete software systems.
